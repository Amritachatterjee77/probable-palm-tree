Time is the distance between the occurrence of two events. Distance is the length of space between two objects or events. Time can be measured in kilometers ("How long is it to Babylon?" "Six hundred and thirty kilometers.") and distance can be measured in years ("How far is it to Eden?" "A lifetime, and then some.")
